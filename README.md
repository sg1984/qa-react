This project was developed as a challenge and I use it do learn React.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) so I could learn how to start.


Clone or download the project and enter in the folder created:

```
cd /path-to/wherever-the/code-is
```  

Run the npm installer:
```
npm install
```  

Now, to see the application alive, just type:
```
npm start
```  

If there is any question/suggestion, please let me know. Can be via issue or via [Sandro Galina](https://sandrogallina.com/).<br>
